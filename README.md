# Macabre-8-ball
Here`s my first project, made entirely by me, the images, icons, etc..


This app was made only for fun, and to exercise my skills with Xcode and the Swift language!
Macabre-8-ball is a different version of the Magic one, that changes the original answers to creepy ones! It`s very funny for people who are bored, or indecised xD


This project do not follow any pattern, even because it`s too simple!


Using the project!

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Build and run the project. (project made on Iphone 11)
3. The project will open in a simulator. (or on Iphone if you have one)
4. To generate the answers just hit the "ASK ME" button!

The project will generate the answer to your question, based on "yes" or "no".
